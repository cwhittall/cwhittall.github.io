During my PhD, I had the opportunity to assist with various undergraduate courses at the University of Southampton:
* <b>Computer labs:</b> assisting students with programming tasks (MATH1058 Op. Research and Mathematical Computing; MATH3018 Numerical Methods)
* <b>Self-paced:</b> providing face-to-face marking and instruction for undergraduate engineering students taking their mathematical methods self-study course (MATH1054/55)
* <b>Coursework marking:</b> marking submitted problem sets (MATH1057 Dynamics and Relativity; MATH3006 Relativity, Black Holes and Cosmology) and class tests (MATH3018)

Whilst an undergraduate, I also volunteered for the University of Cambridge's STIMULUS programme, taking the role of teaching assistant for a mathematics class at a local sixth form.
