My name is Chris Whittall and I am a PhD student at the University of Southampton. 

Research Interests
------
I am interested in topics in gravitational physics, including: 
* General Relativity
* Black Holes
* Gravitational Waves
* Self-force and EMRIs

My current research involves the development of frequency-domain methods for calculating the gravitational self-force during hyperbolic binary black hole encounters. My planned thesis title is "Frequency-domain approach to self-force in hyperbolic scattering" and Prof. Leor Barack (primary) and Dr Adam Pound (secondary) are my supervisors. Funding for my project is provided by EPSRC.
