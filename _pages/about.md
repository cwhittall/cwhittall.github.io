My name is Chris Whittall and I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the University of Birmingham Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy. 

Research Interests
------
I am interested in topics in gravitational wave physics, especially waveform modelling for relativistic compact binaries. My areas of expertise include: 
* Gravitational self-force
* Gravitational scattering
* Surrogate modelling

I am currently researching methods to accelerate the evaluation of gravitational waveform templates for next-generation gravitational wave detectors using reduced order modelling and artificial neural networks.

I am also actively interested in gravitational self-force, and in particular its application to the problem of black hole <i>scattering</i>. My PhD research centred on the development of frequency-domain numerical methods for calculating the self-force during hyperbolic binary black hole encounters. My [thesis](https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/494760/) was titled "Frequency-domain approach to self-force in hyperbolic scattering", and Prof. Leor Barack (primary) and Prof. Adam Pound (secondary) were my supervisors. Funding for that project was provided by EPSRC.

I am a member of the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, Einstein Telescope Collaboration, and core member of the LISA Consortium.
