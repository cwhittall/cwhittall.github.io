True	2024-06-13	Black hole scattering near the transition to plunge: Self-force and resummation of post-Minkowskian theory	Physical Review D	PRD	2024-08-21	In this paper we demonstrate how strong-field self-force information can be used to resum weak-field post-Minkowskian series for the scatter angle during hyperbolic encounters, significantly extending the latter's domain of validity.

True	2025-09-25	Frequency-domain self-force calculations using Gegenbauer reconstruction	Physical Review D	PRD	2025-12-01	In this paper we explore the use of the Gegenbauer re-projection technique for time-domain reconstruction in frequency-domain self-force calculations. This approach promises significant improvements over the conventional "EHS" approach to self-force calculations for hyperbolic and highly-eccentric elliptical orbits.	C. Whittall, L. Barack and O.
