2024-06-13	Black hole scattering near the transition to plunge: Self-force and resummation of post-Minkowskian theory	Physical Review D	PRD	2024-08-21	In this paper we demonstrate how strong-field self-force information can be used to resum weak-field post-Minkowskian series for the scatter angle during hyperbolic encounters, significantly extending the latter's domain of validity.
